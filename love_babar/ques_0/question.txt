Array reverse or reverse a array means changing the position of each number of the given array to its opposite position from end, i.e. if a number is at position 1 then its new position will be Array.length, similarly if a number is at position 2 then its new position will be Array.length – 1, and so on.


Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string.

 Problem statement

Given an array/list 'ARR' of integers and a position ‘M’. You have to reverse the array after that position.

Example:

We have an array ARR = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and M = 3 , considering 0 
based indexing so the subarray {5, 6} will be reversed and our 
output array will be {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5}.
